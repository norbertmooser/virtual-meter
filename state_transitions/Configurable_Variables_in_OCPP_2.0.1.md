### Configurable Variables in OCPP 2.0.1

The **SetVariables** message in OCPP 2.0.1 allows a CSMS (Central System) to modify configurable parameters within a charging station. Below is a structured table of configurable variables categorized by functionality:

| **Category**               | **Variable Name**              | **Component**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

### **Additional Notes**

- **Persistence**: Configurable variables with `ReadWrite` mutability are required to persist across reboots and power cycles.
- **Device Model Dependence**: Available variables depend on the charging station's model and manufacturer. Consult specific documentation for exact configurations.

This table summarizes key variables and their roles in configuring and managing charging stations using OCPP 2.0.1. Let me know if you'd like further clarification or additions!
