# List of States with Explanations

| **State**               | **Description**                                                                 | **Key Actions**                                                                                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Idle**                | The EVSE is not engaged in any active session. Available for new connections.   | Monitor idle energy consumption. Transition to `Reserved` or `Waiting for Authorization`.         |
| **Reserved**            | The EVSE is reserved for a specific user or session.                           | Accept remote start commands. Reset to `Idle` if the reservation expires.                         |
| **Waiting for Authorization** | The EV is connected, waiting for user or vehicle authorization.                | Validate user credentials or Plug-and-Charge certificates. Transition to `Preparing to Charge`.    |
| **Preparing to Charge**  | Authorization is complete; EVSE is preparing to deliver power.                 | Send tariff and pricing details. Handle grid constraints. Transition to `Charging`.               |
| **Charging**            | Energy transfer to the EV is active.                                           | Send periodic `MeterValues`. Handle pause commands or disconnection. Transition to `Discharging`. |
| **Discharging**         | Energy is discharged from the EV to the grid (V2G functionality).              | Monitor energy returned to the grid. Transition to `Idle` when discharging is complete.           |
| **Limited Charging**    | Charging is reduced due to grid constraints or demand response requirements.   | Update `ChargingProfile`. Transition back to `Charging` when constraints are removed.             |
| **Paused**              | Charging or discharging is temporarily stopped.                                | Resume charging or discharging. Transition to `Idle` if session times out.                        |
| **Overstay**            | EV remains connected after charging is complete.                               | Notify user. Apply overstay charges. Transition to `Idle` when unplugged.                         |
| **Battery Maintenance** | Charging is adjusted to maintain the EV batteryâ€™s health. The `TransactionEvent` message can be used to notify the CSMS about a state transition or event related to battery maintenance. The `TriggerReason` field can include a reason such as `Other` (if no predefined reason fits) or use a custom extension. | Notify user and CSMS. Transition back to `Charging` when maintenance is complete.                 |
| **Faulted**             | Hardware or software error has occurred.                                       | Notify CSMS. Attempt recovery. Transition to `Idle` if resolved.                                  |
| **Unavailable**         | EVSE is set to an unavailable state or persistent faults exist.                | Monitor for recovery or manual reset. Transition to `Idle` when resolved.                         |
